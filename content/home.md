<h3 style="text-align:center"><i>A blog about statistics with R (and other things I find interesting)</i></h3>

![](img/divider.png)

As the title says, this is a blog about statistics with [R](https://www.r-project.org/). It is also about open source, open science, data analysis, programming, and more. Why? Because the best way for me to understand things is by writing a small document about it. If you want to know more about me, go to the [about page](./about).

_The website is under construction - I am transferring it from an old repository. In the meantime, you can read the articles I have already transferred._
