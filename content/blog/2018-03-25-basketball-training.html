<div id="introduction" class="section level2">
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I was on holiday and had to wait a while. Fortunately, close to where I was sitting there was a kid playing basketball all by himself. Of course I had to record how many hits and misses he made, to keep it as a nice dataset for further analysis.</p>
<p>Here is the dataset:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>basket &lt;- c(&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;hit&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;hit&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;, &quot;miss&quot;,
            &quot;hit&quot;,&quot;hit&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;, &quot;miss&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,
            &quot;miss&quot;,&quot;hit&quot;,&quot;hit&quot;,&quot;hit&quot;,&quot;miss&quot;,&quot;hit&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="what-can-we-do-with-this" class="section level2">
<h2>What can we do with this?</h2>
<p>Firstly, we can describe how often the kid manages to score a point:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018-03-25-basketball-training_files/figure-html/plot-1.svg" width="672" /></p>
<p>So it looks like the kid misses a bit more than he hits. But there is much more information in this dataset: besides whether the kid hits or misses, we can say something about the <em>sequence</em> of these events.</p>
</div>
<div id="transition-matrix" class="section level2">
<h2>Transition matrix</h2>
<p>From a sequence of observations, it is possible to construct a transition matrix</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{bmatrix}
A &amp; B \\
C &amp; D 
\end{bmatrix}
\]</span> Where the elements indicate the probability that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>: a hit is followed by another hit</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>: a hit is followed by a miss</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>: a miss is followed by a hit</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>: a miss is followed by another miss</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> indicate how likely it is to <em>transition</em> from hit to miss and vice versa, whereas <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> indicate how likely it is to stay in the same state (<em>transition</em> to self).</p>
<p>If we don’t know the true probabilities, we can enter the observed probabilities into the matrix. Here is an <code>R</code> function for generating the transition matrix from the data vector of before:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>transMat &lt;- function(x, prob = TRUE) {
  X &lt;- t(as.matrix(x))
  tt &lt;- table( c(X[,-ncol(X)]), c(X[,-1]) )
  if (prob) tt &lt;- tt / rowSums(tt)
  tt
}

transitionMatrix &lt;- transMat(basket)
print(transitionMatrix, digits = 2)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       
##         hit miss
##   hit  0.43 0.57
##   miss 0.36 0.64</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="markov-chain" class="section level2">
<h2>Markov chain</h2>
<p>This transition matrix completely defines the 2-state markov chain. Assuming these probabilities are stable, we can now generate processes just like the one we observed. And we can nicely visualise it using <a href="http://setosa.io/ev/markov-chains/">this markov chain generator post</a> by <a href="http://setosa.io/ev/">setosa</a>. Go to <a href="http://setosa.io/markov/index.html#%7B%22tm%22%3A%5B%5B0.43%2C0.57%5D%2C%5B0.36%2C0.64%5D%5D%7D">this link</a> to play around!</p>

</div>
<div id="steady-state" class="section level2">
<h2>Steady state</h2>
<p>If we assume this chain is stable over time, there is another nice property. Irrespective of the initial probabilities of hitting or missing that we choose, after a few steps of the markov process, the probability of hitting the basket already converges to the <em>steady state</em>:</p>
<p><img src="/blog/2018-03-25-basketball-training_files/figure-html/initprob-1.svg" width="672" /></p>
<p>In general, we can calculate the steady state easily from the transition matrix:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>someBigNumber &lt;- 1000
diag(transitionMatrix %^% someBigNumber)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       hit      miss 
## 0.3846154 0.6153846</code></pre>
<p>Note that this leads to a similar but different result than simply counting the probability of hitting or missing as a table, as we did in the first figure:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>table(basket)/length(basket)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## basket
##       hit      miss 
## 0.3636364 0.6363636</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="questions" class="section level1">
<h1>Questions</h1>
<ul>
<li>What should we trust here? The naïve probabilities or the markov steady state?</li>
<li>Which assumptions lead to this discrepancy?</li>
<li>Does the transition matrix really contain more relevant information about this process than the observed hit rate?</li>
</ul>
</div>
